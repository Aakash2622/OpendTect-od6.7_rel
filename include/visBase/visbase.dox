  Visualisation - Open Inventor-based tools

  All 3D visualisation in OpendTect is COIN based. COIN is an implementation
  of the OpenInventor interface sepecification. As usual, the external package
  (i.e. COIN) is not visible to any object outside this module.
  This module can be seen as a layer on top of the COIN library. Compliant with
  the 'DIF' principle (Don't implement the future), the layer only contains
  those tools that are really used in OpendTect.

  The function initODInventorClasses() initialises our own 
  Inventor classes, which are in fact extensions of the COIN library. 
  These classes can be found is SoOD. The 'vis' classes in this module are 
  used in the rest of OpendTect. 

  In the 3D visualisation world you'll see that it is almost unavoidable that
  all objects will be managed by a centralised manager. That is
  DataManager. 

  The main classes for displaying scene objects are:
  - TextureRect, for inlines, crosslines and timeslices.
  - RandomTrack, for random lines.
  - CubeView, for the volume viewer.
  - Marker, for picks.
  - HorizonSection, for Horizons.
  - visBase::Well, for wells.
