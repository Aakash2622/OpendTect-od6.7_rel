Contains experiemental code that performs FFTs on NVIDIA graphic cards
(Geoforce 8800 and up). Tests show that the speed is lower than FFTW for
steering volumes, since the data io is too high, and the fft-time is relatively
short.

To compile, you need to have CUDA installed for your system and set the
OD_CUDADIR to the installation.
